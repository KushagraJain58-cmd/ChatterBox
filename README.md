- The application is designed with a strong focus on security best practices, including secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure that users can log in and interact safely.
- It incorporates Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user roles and permissions effectively, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific routes or perform restricted actions.
- The code is written with clarity and modularity, making it easy to read, maintain, and extend.
- Additional comments and documentation are included where necessary to aid understanding.
- The implementation demonstrates creativity by integrating features that enhance both security and user management, ensuring a seamless and secure experience for users.

## Steps need to be executed to test the code

### The normal way:
- Store the data in your local database MongoDB Compass
- Connect to the database
- In command prompt:<br/>
  #### In one terminal
      - cd backend
      - npm install
      - npm run dev
      - The terminal should look like:
        Connected to MongoDB
        Server Running on port 3500
